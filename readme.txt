This is a very basic plugin that will add a floating social sidebar to your posts/pages which is responsive for smaller resolutions.   

== Description ==
This plugin will add a sidebar to your post/page which will float with the content making it easier for people to share it or like it whenever they feel like doing so. This social bar is responsive in nature and it comes under the title by defaults for smaller resolutions where it cannot fit to the left of the content making it highly usable for people who have thier users on all the resolutions.

You can also decide if you want it for pages or posts or both. Plugin also allows you set the default position under the title if you want to.
